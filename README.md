- Hi, I’m Steve Piccolo.

- I’m interested in data, machine learning, and AI.

- I’m majoring in Computer Science at Rowan College of South Jersey. At the moment, I'm sharpening my skills in Python, C++, SQL, and Java.

- I’m looking to collaborate with other entry-level programmers on novel solutions to real-world problems, especially if those solutions utilize machine learning and AI. I'm currently working on a personal project with the goal of making mass gatherings safer by analyzing dense crowd behavior and helping event organizers to more effectively plan safe venue layouts and schedules.
