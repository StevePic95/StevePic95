- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Piccolo.

- 👀 I’m interested in workflow automation, data architecture, systems design, and machine learning.

- 🌱 I’m majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rowan College of South Jersey. At the moment, I'm sharpening my skills in Python, C++, SQL, and Powershell.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other entry-level programmers on small but novel solutions involving data analytics or workflow automation.
