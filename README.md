- Hi, I’m Steve Piccolo.

- I’m interested in task automation, data architecture, and DS/ML/DL.

- I’m majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rowan College of South Jersey. At the moment, I'm sharpening my skills in Python, C++, SQL, and R.

- I’m looking to collaborate with other entry-level programmers on small but novel solutions involving data analytics or workflow automation.

- Shoot me an email at stevepic95@gmail.com
